# SSL Wireshark Plugin

## Installing

Running `install.sh` will install the dependencies, create the directories in your `$HOME/.wireshark`, then copy the lua script and the java application with his resources inside each proper directory.

## Dependencies

This plugin and its associated scripts and programs all depend on [nmap](http://nmap.org/), [arpspoof](http://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/dsniff/), [sslstrip](http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslstrip/) and of course [wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).

Normally, all dependencies have been installed automatically during the installation process.
