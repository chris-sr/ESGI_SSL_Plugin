Install python :

    First, we need to install the dependencies required for SSLStrip. These include Python and a "twisted-web" Python module. Install these by using the apt-get command we've previously learned; type "apt-get install python" (use sudo [super user do] if you're not root or su) and then "apt-get install python-twisted-web"
    Once these dependencies are installed correctly by our apt-get, we can move on.
    Next, download the SSLStrip tar file. We've done this with Aircrack and Ettercap, so you might have a slight idea what the next steps are, and if you do, try doing it yourself first to see if you can!
    The file is located here. Save to your desktop or home or any folder you can remember and navigate to.
    Make sure you navigate to this folder before issuing the commands below!
    Of course now we're going to extract the tar file with the command "tar -zxvf sslstrip-0.9.tar.gz" and then move into the newly created directory with "cd sslstrip-0.9"
    You should now be in that folder, check this by typing "pwd"
    Next, type "python ./setup.py install" and it should install without any errors. Again, if you're not root or a superuser, use the "sudo" command before the above command.
